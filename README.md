# Control-Box

*Actually an alpha project.*


Prototype intended to be able to launch local sounds first or via a jack.
The box can be modified easily to launch any type of command.

In the following steps it will be connected to an i2c bus to declan some things manually.


This project contains a UNO arduino and a "DFPlayer" module. The latter plays MP3s located on an SD card.
